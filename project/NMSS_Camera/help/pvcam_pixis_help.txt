Dear Arpad Jakab,

This error occur under 3 circumstances:
1. The PVCAM.ini file is missing or there are no entries in it. Run the
RSConfig.exe program to generate the ini file. It should look like this:
[Camera_1]
Type=1
Name=Camera1a
Driver=apausb.sys:pixis
Port=0
ID=1001070001
2. Another occurrence is when the program is started before the camera
is turned on. The camera should be turned on before you start your
program or acquire data.
3. Also make sure that Windows is recognizing that you have a USB device
connected. Sometimes Windows does not see the USB device, therefore
there is no driver loaded.

The drivers for this camera can be downloaded from the link below.

Comments: I've got a PIXIS 400. Using PVCAM I'm experiencing in
reliability of image acquisition. Occasionally the camera doesn't
respond and I get the "C0_CNTRL_CREATE_FAILED: Coldn't create controller
object for camera".
Could you please send me the most recent released driver for this
camera. I hope this might fix the problems.

Thanks
Arpad Jakab
